# UTTA Development (Phase One - Chatbot)

An AI-powered educational simulation chatbot designed to help teachers develop and refine their teaching strategies through interactive text-based practice with a simulated second-grade student.

The application works through three main components that interact seamlessly to provide a realistic teaching simulation:

1. **User Interface**: Handles teacher interactions through both terminal and web interfaces
2. **AI Engine**: Processes inputs and generates contextual responses using LLM technology
3. **Knowledge Base**: Manages teaching scenarios, strategies, and interaction history

## Application Components

### 1. Core AI Engine

The AI Engine is the core of our application, handling:
- Natural language processing of teacher inputs
- Context management for conversations
- LLM-based response generation
- Response evaluation and feedback

**Team Contributions:**
- AI Team: Model integration, prompt engineering, evaluation metrics
- Data Team: Training data preparation, response patterns
- Web Team: API integration points, response handling

### 2. Knowledge Management System

The Knowledge Management System handles:
- Storage and retrieval of teaching scenarios
- Vector-based similarity search
- Response pattern matching
- Performance analytics

**Team Contributions:**
- Data Team: Database design, data preprocessing, analytics
- AI Team: Embedding generation, similarity algorithms
- Web Team: Data visualization, export functionality

### 3. User Interface System

The User Interface System provides:
- Interactive chat interface
- Real-time feedback display
- Progress tracking and visualization
- Session management

**Team Contributions:**
- Web Team: Frontend development, UX design, responsiveness
- AI Team: Response formatting, feedback presentation
- Data Team: Analytics visualization, data export

### 4. Integration Flow

    participant UI as Interface
    participant Engine as AI Engine
    participant KB as Knowledge Base
    
    UI->>Engine: Teacher Input
    Engine->>KB: Query Knowledge
    KB-->>Engine: Relevant Data
    Engine->>Engine: Process Response
    Engine-->>UI: Generated Response
    UI->>KB: Store Interaction
    KB-->>UI: Update Analytics
```

The integration flow shows how components interact:
1. User input processing
2. Knowledge base queries
3. Response generation
4. Feedback presentation
5. Analytics updates

**Team Contributions:**
- AI Team: Core processing pipeline, model optimization
- Data Team: Data flow, storage optimization
- Web Team: Interface integration, real-time updates
