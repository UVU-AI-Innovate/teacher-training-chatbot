### 1. Pedagogical Components

#### Teaching Strategies Assessment
- **Time-based Strategies** (20%)
  - Morning: Structured activities, clear expectations
  - After Lunch: Movement integration, energy management
  - Late Afternoon: Short tasks, varied activities

- **Learning Style Alignment** (20%)
  ```mermaid
  graph LR
      V[Visual] --> Show[Show & Demonstrate]
      A[Auditory] --> Tell[Tell & Discuss]
      K[Kinesthetic] --> Do[Do & Practice]
      
      style V fill:#f9f
      style A fill:#bbf
      style K fill:#bfb
  ```

- **Behavioral Management** (30%)
  - Attention strategies
  - Frustration management
  - Engagement techniques
  - Positive reinforcement

- **Subject-Specific Support** (30%)
  - Math: Concrete to abstract progression
  - Reading: Phonics and comprehension strategies
  - Cross-subject integration

### 2. Student Simulation Model

    States --> Response[Student Response]

    style States fill:#bbf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style Factors fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

#### Student State Components
1. **Cognitive State**
   - Understanding level (0-1.0)
   - Attention span
   - Subject comprehension

2. **Emotional State**
   - Engagement level
   - Frustration tolerance
   - Confidence

3. **Behavioral Manifestations**
   - Physical indicators
   - Verbal responses
   - Interaction patterns

### 3. AI Integration

graph TB
    subgraph Input["Teacher Input"]
        TR[Response]
        ST[Strategy]
    end

    subgraph Processing["AI Processing"]
        direction TB
        NLP[Language Analysis]
        Context[Context Integration]
        Strategy[Strategy Matching]
    end

    subgraph Output["Educational Output"]
        Feedback[Teacher Feedback]
        Reaction[Student Reaction]
        Metrics[Performance Metrics]
    end

    style Input fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style Processing fill:#bbf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style Output fill:#bfb,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

### 4. Learning Scenarios

Example Scenario Structure:
```
Time: Morning
Context: Math Class
Topic: Two-digit Addition
Student State:
- Learning Style: Visual
- Current Challenge: Number Sense
- Behavioral State: Frustrated
```

#### Scenario Progression
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant T as Teacher
    participant S as Student
    participant A as AI System
    
    Note over S: Shows Frustration
    T->>S: Teaching Response
    S->>A: State Update
    A->>S: Generate Reaction
    S->>T: Student Response
    A->>T: Feedback & Score
```
